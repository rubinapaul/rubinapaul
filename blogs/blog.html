One sunday evening, while driving through the highway suddenly in the middle of the route the rain started downpouring. As the rain increased its intensity, it didn’t affect me as i was in the car protected from bad weather outside. I just kept driving thinking that how the car saves us from the everything that happens outside of the car but not letting it reach us. At the same moment, i heard the Holy Spirit(Spirit of Jesus) saying to me “circumstances should not affect you in the same way” and it is so true.
We all have been in rain at least once, sometimes got drenched and sometimes not.The truth of the life is that we cannot get by with it but we certainly can understand how to deal with it. We can be cautious to let things not reach our hearts but we are not always successful in that. That does not mean we have the right to blame ourselves. We have to shake-off the self-pity attitude and take some action to get our joy back. We can do things like being with some positive people, listen to motivational speech or video, go for shopping or the best is to help some friend, family member or the one we know is in need. 
The things that are going around us should not reach our hearts. When our heart is not affected by external things then we are able to drive our life on right track, making sound decisions for self and others. It will help us to complete the assignments we have for this life with sound mind and joy.
We always have to remind ourselves that “to be in a rain, is not a choice” but “to be drenched or not” is a choice and we have to choose wisely.
