			<h2>Winning the battle of the mind</h2>
		Battle of the mind is something that we all has experienced  in our life. Surprisingly, this battle has not started recently or from 21st century onwards as many of us think. It began with human race itself. The day Adam(man) and Eve(woman) were created, shortly after that the enemy of mankind started influencing the mind of Eve and she gave into those thoughts. Her thought became action after heeded the voice of the enemy in her mind and she persuaded Adam to eat the fruit of Law(bringing judgement on self) and they both disobeyed God. As soon as she disobeyed what was asked not to do death came to mankind. Death was never the plan of God for our lives, it came when we brought judgement on ourselves after sin entered us. She ruined the relationship not with God only but with man too.Now they both saw their weaknesses. So we can know from this that there is a battle in the mind which can ruin relationships and we have to be wise to not let the thoughts wander. We have to first acknowledge the truth then only we can overcome it.It is said in Bible that “Truth makes you free” which means if you know the truth(our maker) then Truth will set you free. We cannot win the battle unless we know it exist.
We have to take care of our thought life.To identify how we can discern where are thoughts lining up, let me give you an example, we might be doing grocery shopping but our mind may be busy worrying about work or situation or any thing wrong about any person we don't get along well. If are thoughts are negative then we are getting influence from outside and that’s not from God or our well wisher. These thoughts are not manufactured from our mind so don’t think for a second that you are not good person. God has made mankind in His own image and we all are good but we have to discipline our mind and take care of negative thoughts in our mind which comes from the enemy. We have to make use of  “delete” button everyday to delete any negative thought from our mind. We have to take responsibility to discipline our mind. We have to fill our mind with good positive thoughts but not leaving mind empty. If we will not fill our minds with positivity and negativity will be filled. This is needed the most as today many behavior patterns and physical illnesses are rooted in this thing. and if not taken care may lead to damaging effects.
Let’s ask ourself everyday and twice/thrice a day what are we thinking about?Are those thoughts productive?If not, why are we thinking about them. Some might say “my situation is like that, i can’t stop thinking unless its over”. But that is making things worse, your health is getting affected by negative thoughts. The results are sometimes not immediate but shows up later. We need to take charge of our thinking so that it will not impact us and people close to us. We should only do what we can and let God do the rest. We can pray about and involve God in that matter so that through His help we can have a breakthrough.
Some of the ways we can discipline our minds are like listening to positive messages, being with positive people, reading encouraging books, writing down often or daily what’s going on in life or vent out to friend or family and pray about it. Praying helps getting rid of the toxic thoughts. The mind has to be discipline before it ruins relationship of any kind and damage our life.It not only impacts us but our future generations also if not dealt and have victory over it.Someone has to take responsibility to break the pattern for the future generation and let them walk with ease.
It’s good to RESTART our mind everyday and use the delete button at night for removing all toxic junk thoughts and see its impact.
