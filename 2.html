			<h2>Meet with the Lord</h2>
		How marvellous is to meet our creator when all the things of the world gets blurred in His majesty. I believe that every person on this earth gets an opportunity at least once when they can chose to be with God or not. We all encounter Him. Some understands early that He is the One who can help us through this life and some later and sadly few never. 

There’s a parable in the Bible that happened in Israel.  There was an old man, who was sitting at the riverside for 38 years. According to the ancient Israelites, there was an angel who used to come once a year and shake the water. The one who gets in the river first, gets healed from their sicknesses. This old man was laying there from long time but had no help from anyone as he was all alone. When Jesus was on earth He passed by that river and asked the old man, “Do you want to be healed?” and he said “yes”. Then Jesus said to him “Take your bed and walk” and he got instantly healed and started walking. He left that place with rejoicing at the very same moment.

I heard the same narration while driving back home from work on FM, and the gist out of that incident was blame on the old man; may be he didn't want to be healed or he was lazy. This is not the first time I heard the narration in this manner but this time i asked God “Why people always blame him? May be he is an old man who needs help” and instantly God revealed to me that all other people who got healed did not met me face to face but to heal this man I myself came to meet him and help him. And i was awestruck and smile came to my face thinking that something good came out of this incident which i  have never heard of.

Yes, that’s how our God is. If there is no one to help us, then God himself will come to help us at the place of our need and we will have the privilege to meet him face to face. Like in above incident Jesus himself came to the place where the old man needs help. God is same yesterday, today and forever and He can do for us the same thing.
