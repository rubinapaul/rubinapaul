			How Great thou Art! It is so marvellous to see the work of the Lord. The Art of the Lord is magnificence. 
			Everything we see around us in nature is His Art. It's like He painted the live painting. We are His Art and how
			uniquely He designed us.
			
			It's cherishing to see the beauty of His Art and He made all things beautiful in His time. He made this nature
			for us so that we can enjoy it. Likewise, many things God gave to us to have dominion for good but we humans lost
			it and then Jesus came down to earth to take back the Dominion on our behalf as human and gave us back the 
			dominion over evil and to be prosperous.
			
			Love of God, principles of Kingdom of God and how to have dominion in our life is the central theme of this site.
