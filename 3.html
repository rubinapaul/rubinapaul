			<h2>Everything gets Changed</h2>Anyone who has experienced the Lord as a Savior, can relate to this title.The day we met Lord and  experienced His Love in such a deep measure that we felt Him close to us tangibly. And then we start our walk with Him and can’t stop thinking about Him. When we sit, walk, talk or do anything we think about Him and the reason is we started Loving him. We use the name of “Jesus” like a name which can do anything for us, from the biggest to the smallest.
The name of Jesus has higher authority over the heavens and the earth. At the mention of His name everything changes. As if drunk in His love can’t stop loving Him by talking to Him or listening worshipping songs and humming around . And then God starts pouring His Love in our hearts to heal us beyond time. We can’t see what are the things that need to be mended, but He knows and through His Love He heals us. 
I remember when i got Saved and accepted Christ as my personal Savior, i just love listening to worship songs and humming around everywhere. I used to ask the Lord for each and every minute detail what to do and what not to. And He starts communicating the answers through Word(in the Bible) or speaking directly or through dreams and visions and sometimes through people prophetically. And as He kept loving, He changes me and filled all the gaps and missing things in my life to do what i was destined to. He restored me back to wholeness.
And that's what our journey is all about. To allow Him to love us and equipping us to do the assignment He gave us before forming us in the womb. In this journey, He changes and make us new in His image day by day and make us “King and priest” to reign in Life.
