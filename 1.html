			<h2>Reconciliation flows from Love</h2><br/>
			Reconciliation is a word so deep and moves my heart when i hear this. I never felt the same unless i had experienced the compassion hidden in it. As i was going through tough time at my workplace, i got so busy in my work that it drifted me away from peace of God but every time i felt tired somehow i hear some awesome worship songs or hear a sermon or i met someone at my workplace whose words are prophetic for that moment as they have been sent by God. 

One day sitting on bed after being back from office i was listening music and was exhausted by work at the same instance i felt the presence of God so strong on me  that i just knelt down beside my bed and one word came after talking to God “Reconciliation”. After that time God reminded me all the time he wants to reconcile not just one day but everyday. When i reconnected all the instances and moments when through different events my heart was filled with God’s love and joy i came to know how He longs to be connected to us because we are His.

That's God’s nature of reconciliation. He not only wants us to be connected to Him but he also take steps in action for that. It’s sin that always wants us away from God but God knows our frame so He Himself comes to reconcile because He loves us.And as God and Love is same so it flows from God.

As we all are in God’s image He expects us to do the same. He wants us to reconcile with family, friends or with anyone whom we are not in good terms as its enemy who is against relationship but we can overlook the wrong things and be nice to them. If it's difficult to be nice then silent communication is best start or just focus on positive part of that person. God does not asks us to do something He will not demonstrate. He will first demonstrate us,then reveal to us and after that same thing can flow or manifest through us easily.

And here’s the fruit of that- A fountain of joy is released through reconciliation!!
